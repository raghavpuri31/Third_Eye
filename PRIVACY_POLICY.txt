PRIVACY POLICY
2016

ColorNamer uses the camera on the device for live preview, but does not share or upload 
images gathered by the camera in any way.

SimplyMoustache uses the camera on the device and stores captured images
on that same device, and only shares images if the user explicitly requests it, with
the apps that the user explicitly suggests.

For both apps, information from the camera is never collected or used by the app
creator. If that changes, this privacy policy will be updated.
